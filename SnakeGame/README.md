# Snake Game - Python Implementation

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic Snake Game using the Pygame library. The game allows players to control a snake and try to eat food while avoiding collisions with the snake's own body and the game window boundaries.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library (install using `pip install pygame`)

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required Pygame library by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. Run the `main.py` script to start the game:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

4. To start the game, press Space.

5. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.

6. The snake will move automatically, and your goal is to eat the red food dots to grow longer.

7. The game ends if the snake collides with its own body or goes out of the game window boundaries.

8. Try to achieve the highest score by eating as much food as possible!

## Features

- Simple and intuitive controls using arrow keys.
- Real-time display of the player's current score and high score.
- Game over screen with the option to play again.
